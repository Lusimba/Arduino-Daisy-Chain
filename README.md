# Arduino-Daisy-Chain
This project is meant to help people with big projects that need more than the standard IO pin-out on a single arduino to combine the power of many boards. While this project works for the Arduino Uno (ATMEGA 328P), it can be modified to suit other micro-controller development boards.
